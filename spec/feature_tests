* Airport Challenge feature tests

User story 1:
As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport and confirm that it has landed

Tests:
require './lib/airport.rb'
airport = Airport.new
plane = Plane.new
airport.land(plane)

require './lib/airport.rb'
airport = Airport.new
plane = Plane.new
airport.land(plane)
airport.planes
